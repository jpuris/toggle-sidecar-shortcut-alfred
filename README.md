4. Make sure to allow any missing accessibility privileges

## Compatibility

### Tested

## Attribution

The Apple Script that powers the shortcut's functionality was inspired by reddit post [Ventura AppleScript toggle for Sidecar](https://www.reddit.com/r/applescript/comments/ylsv37/ventura_applescript_toggle_for_sidecar) by [u/itcouldvebeensogood](https://www.reddit.com/user/itcouldvebeensogood/)

## Disclaimer

The Apple script uses macOS GUI elements and Apple may introduce breaking changes with newer updates. I will try to keep this up to date with newer macOS versions, but will not be my top priority.
